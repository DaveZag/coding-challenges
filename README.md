# Coding Challenges

"Coding-Challenges" is a GitHub repository created with the purpose of honing coding skills through practical application. This repository houses a collection of coding challenges that range from beginner to advanced levels, covering a wide range of concepts, algorithms, and data structures. Each challenge is designed to test and improve various coding skills such as problem-solving, optimization, and algorithmic thinking.

> Keeping in mind time and space complexity principles and best practices.

Following are the key time and space complexities:

- Constant: O(1)
- Linear time: O(n)
- Logarithmic time: O(n log n)
- Quadratic time: O(n^2)
- Exponential time: 2 ^(n)
- Factorial time: O(n!)
